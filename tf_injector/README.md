## Setup
1. Ensure you have Python 3.10 installed in your working environment
2. Create a virtual environment
```
python -m venv venv_name
source venv_name/bin/activate
```
3. Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Available Models (so far)

The Keras versions of the models, when available, are obtained using the [nobuco](https://github.com/AlexanderLutsenko/nobuco) PyTorch to Keras converter.
The Keras versions of all models share the same structure and weigths, and have similar accuracies to their PyTorch counterpart.

## Dataset transformation
> [!NOTE]
> Dataset transformations have been implemented using Torch, NumPy and TensorFlow functions. Since the output of the preprocessing relying on Torch and NumPy resulted to be exactly the same, while TensorFlow delivered slightly different results that impacted even on the TOP-1 accuracy, NumPy and TensorFlow preprocessing has been both made available.
> The statistics displayed above refer to the Torch (and so NumPy) preprocessing.

### Tensorflow preprocessing
### CIFAR10
```
image = tf.image.convert_image_dtype(image, dtype=tf.float32)
image = (image - (0.4914, 0.4822, 0.4465)) / (0.2023, 0.1994, 0.2010)
```

### CIFAR100
```
image = tf.image.convert_image_dtype(image, dtype=tf.float32)
image = (image - (0.5070751592371323, 0.48654887331495095, 0.4409178433670343)) / (0.2673342858792401, 0.2564384629170883, 0.27615047132568404)
```

### GTSRB
```
image = tf.image.resize(image, [50, 50])
image = tf.image.convert_image_dtype(image, dtype=tf.float32)
image = (image - (0.3403, 0.3121, 0.3214)) / (0.2724, 0.2608, 0.2669)
```
### NumPy preprocessing
### CIFAR10
```
image = image / np.float32(255.0)
image = (image - (0.4914, 0.4822, 0.4465)) / (0.2023, 0.1994, 0.2010)
```

### CIFAR100
```
image = image / np.float32(255.0)
image = (image - (0.5070751592371323, 0.48654887331495095, 0.4409178433670343)) / (0.2673342858792401, 0.2564384629170883, 0.27615047132568404)
```

### GTSRB
```
image = tf.image.resize(image, [50, 50]).numpy()
image = image / np.float32(255.0)
image = (image - (0.3403, 0.3121, 0.3214)) / (0.2724, 0.2608, 0.2669)
```
## Usage
Run as a python module:
```
python -m tf_injector [ARGS, ...]
```
To display the complete usage guide, type
```
python -m tf_injector --help
```
## Input
To run an injection campaign, you will need:
- A target network saved in `.keras` format, saved in `models/<dataset>/<network>.keras`
- A fault list compatible with the target network in csv format (header needed)

| Injection | Layer  |   TensorIndex   | Bit |
|:---------:|:------:|:---------------:|:---:|
|         0 | conv2d |  "(2, 1, 0, 7)" |  15 |
|         1 | conv2d | "(2, 0, 0, 14)" |   5 |


## Outputs
By default, a summarized report of the injection campaign is stored in `reports/<dataset>/<network>/<dataset>_<network>_<datetime>.csv`
By enabling the `--save-outputs` flag, inference outputs are saved as numpy arrays in the same folder, as `<datetime>/clean.npy` for the clean run, and `<datetime>/inj_<inj_id>.npy` for the faulty runs.

### Output metrics

- part 1: Injection info

| Injection | Layer  |   TensorIndex   | Bit |
|:---------:|:------:|:---------------:|:---:|
|         0 | conv2d |  "(2, 1, 0, 7)" |  15 |
|         1 | conv2d | "(2, 0, 0, 14)" |   5 |

- part 2: robustness
    - `top_1_correct`: the label with the maximum score equals the test label (correct inference)
    - `top_5_correct`: the test label is inside the set of the labels which gained the five highest scores
    - `top_1_robust`: Same as top_1_correct, but compared with the predicted labels of the golden inference 
    - `top_5_robust`: Same as top__correct, but compared with the predicted labels of the golden inference 


| top_1_correct | top_5_correct | top_1_robust | top_5_robust |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| 9174 | 9977 | 10000 | 10000 |
| 9174 | 9977 | 10000 | 10000 |

- part 3: other stats
    - `masked`: Number of dataset inferences that identified the fault as masked.
    - `non_critical`: Number of dataset inferences that identified the fault as non-critical.
    - `critical`: Number of dataset inferences that identified the fault as critical (SDC-1).

| n_injections | masked | non_critical | critical |
|:------------:|:------:|:------------:|:--------:|
|        10000 |  10000 |            0 |        0 |
|        10000 |  10000 |            3 |        0 |
